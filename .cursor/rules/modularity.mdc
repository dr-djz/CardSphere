# Organize Code into Multiple Files and Directories

**Description**: Split code based on functionality to avoid monolithic structures.

**Applies to**: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}

**Details**:  
- Use separate directories (e.g., `pages/`, `components/`, `routes/`, `services/`) for distinct purposes.  
- Ensure each file has a single responsibility to enhance modularity and maintainability.
