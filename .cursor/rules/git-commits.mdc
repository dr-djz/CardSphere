# Automate Git Commits After Changes

**Description**: Automatically commit changes to prevent loss of progress.

**Applies to**: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}

**Details**:  
- Commit significant changes to Git with descriptive messages (e.g., "Auto-commit: Updated search logic").  
- Target a working branch (e.g., `feature/dev-progress`) to keep the main branch clean.
