- Manage card listing, buying, and selling processes.
- Support user profiles and seller dashboards.
- Integrate payment gateways for secure transactions in Euro, GBP, etc.
- Enable search functionality with real-time autocomplete.

### API Design Recommendations
- Follow RESTful API principles for consistent, predictable endpoints (e.g., `/api/cards`, `/api/listings`).
- Implement pagination for large datasets like card listings or search results.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve API response times.
- Secure APIs with rate limiting, input validation, and JWT authentication.

## 6. Database Structure & Management

### Database Schema Recommendations
- **Users Table**:
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `username` (VARCHAR)
  - `email` (VARCHAR, unique)
  - `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
  - `role` (ENUM: buyer, seller, admin)
- **Cards Table**:
  - `card_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name` (VARCHAR)
  - `set_name` (VARCHAR)
  - `set_number` (VARCHAR)
  - `rarity` (VARCHAR)
  - `image_url` (VARCHAR)
  - `market_price` (DECIMAL)
- **Listings Table**:
  - `listing_id` (Primary Key)
  - `card_id` (Foreign Key → Cards)
  - `seller_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `condition` (ENUM: Mint, Near Mint, Played, etc.)
  - `price` (DECIMAL)
  - `quantity` (INTEGER)
- **Orders Table**:
  - `order_id` (Primary Key)
  - `buyer_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `seller_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `total_amount` (DECIMAL)
  - `status` (ENUM: pending, shipped, completed, etc.)

### Strategies for Updating Card Databases Regularly
- Schedule automated jobs (e.g., via cron) to fetch new card data from official TCG APIs or sources.
- Use web scraping (where legally permissible) to gather card release information.
- Provide an admin panel for manual updates to card details.
- Implement versioning to track changes in card data over time (e.g., price history).

## 7. Marketplace & Card Valuation System

### Card Listing and Selling Mechanics
- Sellers list cards via a form selecting card name, condition (using PSA grading system 1-10), price, and quantity.
- Include form validation to ensure accurate listings (e.g., valid price ranges).
- Allow sellers to manage inventory through a dedicated dashboard.

### Valuation Algorithms and Analytics
- Calculate market price using an average of recent sales data from the platform.
- Develop algorithms to analyze price trends (e.g., 7-day, 30-day averages).
- Provide analytics on card popularity (e.g., views, sales volume) for transparency.

### Detailed Card Information Displayed on Icons
- Display on each card icon:
  - Card Name
  - Card Image
  - Set Name and Set Number
  - Rarity
  - Condition (Mint, Near Mint, etc.)
  - Lowest Available Price
  - Market Price Trends (e.g., graph or percentage change)
- Use tooltips or modals for additional details to maintain a clean UI.

## 8. Search Functionality & Autocomplete System

### Real-time Search and Predictive Suggestions
- Implement autocomplete via a dedicated search API endpoint (e.g., `/api/search?q=query`).
- Use a debounce function (e.g., 300ms delay) to limit API calls during typing.
- Display suggestions in a dropdown with card names and key details.
- Show detailed stats of the top suggested choice in real-time as the user types.

### Displaying Card Prices in Search Results
- Show the current market price next to each autocomplete suggestion.
- Fetch prices in real-time or from a cached source (e.g., Redis) for performance.

## 9. User Account & Seller Management

### User Authentication & Profiles
- Provide registration and login forms with email verification.
- Allow profile updates (e.g., shipping address, preferred currency, payment methods).
- Use JWT for secure, stateless authentication.

### Seller Tools and Dashboards
- Offer a dashboard for sellers to:
  - Manage listings (add, edit, delete).
  - View sales analytics (e.g., revenue, top-selling cards).
  - Track orders (pending, shipped, completed).
- Include bulk listing uploads (e.g., CSV import) and inventory management tools.
- Send notifications for new orders or buyer messages.

## 10. Localization and GDPR Compliance

### Multilingual Support Implementation
- Use internationalization libraries (e.g., i18next) to manage translations.
- Store translations in JSON files for each language (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, etc.).
- Provide a language selection dropdown in the UI.

### GDPR Considerations
- Implement cookie consent banners and a clear privacy policy.
- Store user data securely with encryption (e.g., AES-256).
- Allow users to access, update, or delete their data via account settings.
- Document data processing activities and appoint a Data Protection Officer if required.

## 11. SEO and Performance Optimization

### SEO
- Use semantic HTML with proper heading structures (H1, H2, etc.).
- Implement meta tags (title, description, keywords) for each page.
- Generate and submit XML sitemaps to search engines.
- Optimize images with descriptive alt text and file names.

### Performance Optimization
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files to reduce load times.
- Use lazy loading for images and non-critical resources.
- Implement caching for static assets (e.g., via DigitalOcean's CDN).
- Optimize database queries with indexing and efficient joins.

## 12. Deployment and Hosting Recommendations

### Hosting Platform
- Use DigitalOcean App Platform for simplicity and scalability.
- Leverage managed PostgreSQL and Redis for database and caching needs.

### Deployment Strategies
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- Use blue-green deployment or canary releases to minimize downtime.
- Monitor performance and errors with tools like Sentry and LogRocket.

## 13. Maintenance, Security, and Updates

### Maintenance
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Perform routine backups of the database and critical data.
- Monitor server health and performance metrics.

### Security
- Enforce HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Updates
- Plan regular feature updates and bug fixes based on user feedback.
